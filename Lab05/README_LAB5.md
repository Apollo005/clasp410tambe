This lab explores the "Snowball Earth" hypothesis, which proposes a radical climatic scenario where the entire Earth was 
completely glaciated approximately 650-700 million years ago. During this hypothetical period, 
the planet would have been covered entirely in ice, with no exposed liquid water or land masses. 
This extraordinary concept is supported by geological evidence such as worldwide glacial striations and deposit formations. 
The hypothesis challenges our understanding of planetary climate systems by suggesting a state of near-total planetary freezing. 
While some scientists support this theory, others argue that achieving and escaping such a global glaciation would be 
physically extremely challenging. An alternative "slushball Earth" hypothesis suggests that while massive glaciation occurred, 
a narrow band of open ocean might have remained around the equator.

In this lab, we will be exploring four different questions. The lab aims to explore the Snowball Earth hypothesis through a sophisticated numerical modeling approach that divides the Earth into latitudinal bands and simulates temperature dynamics. The research will proceed through four interconnected experimental objectives. First, researchers will develop a numerical solver capable of modeling Earth's temperature dynamics, implementing a progressive approach that begins with a basic diffusion solver, then adds spherical correction terms and radiative forcing components, ultimately validating the model by reproducing predefined temperature profiles. The second phase focuses on model calibration, investigating the impact of two key uncertain parameters: thermal diffusivity (λ) and emissivity (ε). By exploring parameter ranges and systematically testing different combinations, the goal is to calibrate the model to accurately reproduce a "warm Earth" temperature profile. This calibration is critical for establishing the model's reliability and predictive capabilities. The third objective examines the sensitivity of the Earth's equilibrium state to initial conditions. By testing diverse scenarios—including a "hot" Earth, a "cold" Earth, and a "flash freeze" scenario—researchers will assess the stability of snowball versus warm Earth solutions. This investigation aims to understand how initial temperature conditions and abrupt changes in albedo can influence long-term climate states. The final experimental objective explores the role of solar radiation in Snowball Earth dynamics. By introducing a solar multiplier factor (γ) and conducting a series of simulations, the research will investigate the relationship between solar forcing and planetary temperature. The ultimate aim is to determine whether the Snowball Earth hypothesis represents a stable planetary equilibrium and to evaluate its scientific validity by considering historical solar variation. Through these comprehensive modeling approaches, the lab seeks to shed light on one of the most intriguing hypotheses in planetary climate science.
