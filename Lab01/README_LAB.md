Wildfires can be modeled as pseudo-stochastic processes where the fire spreads to adjacent areas based on certain probabilities. 
The spread is influenced by factors like temperature, moisture, wind, and vegetation type. 
Areas lacking fuel (e.g., trees or dry grass) or that are already burned cannot sustain fire. 
Thus, both the type of vegetation and the wildfire's progression determine how the fire spreads across a region. 
In this lab, a simple stochastic, universally applicable model for wildfire spread will be developed.

This lab will introduce key Python coding concepts, including array handling, logical loops, procedural coding with functions, 
and plotting using Matplotlib. It will explore the concept of Universality by demonstrating how a single model can be applied to different phenomena, 
such as forest fires and disease spread. Additionally, the code will cover the basic requirements for the Earth 410 lab report.

Comments within the code will walk user through how to run the code!
