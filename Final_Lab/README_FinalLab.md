The relationship between the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and global temperature is a keystone in climate science, representing one of the most important dynamics in understanding Earth’s climate system. With anthropogenic emissions continuing to drive unprecedented increases in CO2 concentrations, the need to model and predict the impacts on global temperature has never been more pressing. This report goes in-depth into the interrelated relationships between atmospheric CO2, heat absorption, and temperature change, using a multi-compartment model to simulate these dynamics over time.

The Earth’s climate is governed by a delicate energy balance, where incoming solar radiation must be offset by outgoing longwave radiation. However, rising CO2 levels disrupt this equilibrium by enhancing the greenhouse effect, leading to increased heat retention in the Earth’s system. Based on the established physical principles underlying the Stefan-Boltzmann law and radiative forcing models, this study looks into how the flux of CO2 between the three major reservoirs- atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial- affects the path of global temperatures. Differential equations, numerical simulations, and scenario analysis in this report aim to provide quantitative information on transient and long-term global temperature variations due to the dynamics of CO2.
