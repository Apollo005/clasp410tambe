This lab investigates heat diffusion within Arctic permafrost layers using forward-difference numerical methods 
for solving one-dimensional diffusion equations. Through this study, we aim to model and understand the thermal 
profiles of permafrost in response to seasonal temperature fluctuations and evaluate how global warming impacts 
these profiles.

We start by implementing a forward-difference solver for the heat equation, assessing solver stability with respect 
to time step, spatial resolution, and diffusion rate. The model is then applied to simulate the permafrost depth 
and active layer characteristics in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, a region experiencing pronounced seasonal temperature 
variations.

Using historical data and simulated warming scenarios, we examine changes in permafrost stability and the depth 
of the active layer, projecting long-term changes due to rising atmospheric temperatures. This lab illustrates the 
impact of climate change on Arctic biomes, focusing on the thermal evolution of permafrost and its implications 
for carbon release and biome stability.
