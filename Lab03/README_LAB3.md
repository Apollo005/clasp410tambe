Energy balance models are important tools to understand the Earth’s climate systems. This lab explores the development of a multi-layer atmospheric energy balance model using the principles of radiative transfer as well as the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The lab devles into the basic assumption that incoming solar radiation must be balanced by outgoing longwave radiation from the Earth and its atmosphere. Starting from a base no-atmosphere model, in this lab, we progressively increase the complexity of the model by adding atmospheric layers. Each layer must balance incoming longwave radiation from the ground and adjacent layers with each layer’s own emitted flux. This lab paper depicts and goes in depth with a generalized N-layer model, where N is an arbitrary number of atmospheric layers.
